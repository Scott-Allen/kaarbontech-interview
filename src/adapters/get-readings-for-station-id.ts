/**
 * 3. Finally, a slightly more in-depth one, but one which still shouldn't take very long:
 * The UK's Environment Agency has a public access API to fetch rainfall data from its network of around 1,000 sensors.
 * Write a function which, given an EA sensor station ID, fetches readings (measures) from that sensor station.
 * The documentation for the EA's API should make this easy enough: https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/rainfall
 * You may use whatever HTTP client you would like. For this task, your code should be able to run under NodeJS (or ts-nodeâ€‹ for Typescript).
